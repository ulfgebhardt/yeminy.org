Our Git who art in the server,
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy branch come.
Thy will be done on localhost,
as it is in the server.
Give us today our daily merge.
And forgive us our conflicts.
As we forgive those who conflict against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
For Thine is the kingdom,
The power and the glory,
Forever, GIT
